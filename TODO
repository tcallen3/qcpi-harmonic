Current Goals:

1.) Move printing sequence into separate function

2.) Revise how initial_bath files deal with vectors to avoid inconsistent
    interface (push_back vs. direct element assignment)

3.) Roll harmonic bath update sequence into Propagator class

4.) Figure out how to combine QCPI update functionality - more of an
    issue since direct path extension is distinct from iterative update

5.) Fix weird implementation of density matrix storage, and factor MPI
    reduction into separate function

6.) Review code and clean general things, improve comments, etc.

7.) Replace NR code and figure out how to test with possibly inconsistent
    Runge-Kutta solvers

8.) Outline how to convert this code to anharmonic version and sort out
    which files need to be included to illustrate
